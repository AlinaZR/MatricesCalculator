Operations you can do in this application:
Create a new matrix named A:                A [5][3]
                                            √ First write number of rows(5), than numebr of columns(3)
Fill the matrix A by new values:            FILL A
Sum matrix A and matrix B:                  A + B
Difference of matrix A and matrix B:        A - B
Product of matrix A and matrix B:           A * B
Product of matrix A and number:             A * number
Copy matrix B to matrix A:                  A = B
Matrix inversion for square matrix A:       INV A
Gauss elimination on matrix A:              GEM A
Rank of a matrix A:                         RANK A
Determinant of a matrix A:                  DET A
Merge matrix A and matrix B:                MERGE A B ROW
                                            √ instead of ROW write COLUMN to marge matrices to column
Split of matrix A :                         SPLIT Z [1][2] (3, 0)
                                            √ in square braces are rows(1) and columns(2) of final matrix
                                            √ in circle braces are coordinates (row(3), column(4)) to
                                              split matrix from
Transpose matrix A:                         TRANS A
Save result of last operation as matrix X:  SAVE X
Print matrix named A:                       PRINT A
Show this instruction again:                HELP
Exit from this program:                     BREAK
__________________________________________________________________
    First word of command always should continue with space
    and than continue with rest of command
    Command HELP is always single. It shows you this instruction.

    !WARNING!
Program is case-insensitive, so matrix named 'A' and matrix named 'a' are same.
Please, don't use keywords
(MERGE, SPLIT, SAVE, DET, RANK, INV, BREAK, HELP, TRANS, GEM and FILL)
as names of matrices else program could work incorrectly.
